# Template react-native-macos Project

Designed to allow for easy starting with macOS development using [Microsoft's `react-native` fork](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native). At the time of writing (release 0.60.0-microsoft.49), there is no built in way to create a new macOS supported project, so this repo provides a new nearly empty project.

## Usage instructions

```
npm install
npm run macos
```

Open `macOS/test.xcodeprod` via Xcode and build the application target.
